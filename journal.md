# flatkeys: the log  
**total hours: ~43.5 hours of clicky clacky chaos, confusion, and keyboard-core memories**  
nothing like building a keyboard from scratch to realize you know nothing and also everything at the same time.  
this is the dev log for *flatkeys* where the goal was to make a clean, minimal, tkl-ish board that doesn’t look like it was made in a garage.  
spoiler: it absolutely was.

**june 9**  
(3 hours)  
started off with the idea dump. i wanted something that was lowkey but not boring  
sketched some cursed layouts. some had knobs. some had too many keys.  
settled on a 60% + function row style. no numpad, i’m not THAT kind of guy  
created a folder called “flat AF keys”. it begins

**june 10**  
(5 hours)  
jumped into fusion 360. modeled the top plate, bottom case  
key spacing was off by a few mm at first. fixed it after crying over gridlines  
learned how fillets work properly. the curves are curving now  
printed a paper layout and pretended to type on it. felt real

**june 11**  
(2.5 hours)  
plate design day  
experimented with cutouts tried isolating each switch for flex (it did not flex)  
added standoff holes, didn’t add support for screw-in stabs yet  
printed the plate on paper again. scissors came out. vibes were solid

**june 12**  
(3 hours)  
case thickness experiments  
2mm walls = nah. 3mm = better. 4mm = feels chunky but safe  
tried fitting a Type-C breakout board into the model. it fit but barely  
this was mostly “adjust, render, stare, repeat” on loop

**june 13**  
(2 hours)  
watched 4 keyboard teardown videos while eating  
took inspo from jelly epoch for case angles  
added slight tilt to the bottom half of the case ergonomic but still clean  
still thinking about adding a brass weight but that’s money i don’t have

**june 14**  
(4 hours)  
back to the plate. added support for screw-in stabs  
made a layered sandwich version for laser cutting  
had to fix kerf offsets. turned out my SVGs were pixel soup  
ran everything through a test export. things finally started to feel sharp

**june 15**  
(2.5 hours)  
random switch-mounting experiments. tried clip-in and plate mount tolerances  
added little tabs for strength. it made the plate uglier but more solid  
also tried making a low-profile version. didn’t go well. scrap it

**june 16**  
(1 hour)  
read like 3 reddit posts on plate materials.  
people are fighting over POM vs FR4 like it’s politics  
decided to try acrylic first. cheap and pretty. worst case, i get RGB diffusion

**june 17**  
(3.5 hours)  
revamped the bottom shell to make it screwless  
snaps + alignment pins. made a fake PCB shape to test spacing  
realized i might need a custom daughterboard. ignored that problem completely

**june 20**  
(3 hours)  
was in a mood to redo the entire top half and i did  
simplified the curves, added internal support, made a magnetic top idea (??)  
won’t even try magnets for now but the model is there if i ever feel brave

**june 22**  
(2 hours)  
exported final DXFs, made a BOM  
went through 4 JST connector datasheets just to find one that fits  
this whole process made me feel like i was prepping for a rocket launch not a keyboard

**june 25 (night)**  
(3 hours)  
got some input from the homies  
realized the case looked kinda chonky from the side view  
completely redesigned the case that night  
lowered the profile, changed the seam line, fixed tolerances

---

**june 26 (morning)**  
(2 hours)  
final export. updated every single file  
cleaned the fusion project like it was going to be graded  
submitted the whole shebang to the HC Highway form  
was half-asleep by then but clicked “submit” anyway
