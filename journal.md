# flatkeys: the logbook  

**total time spent: ~50 hours of CAD pain, keyboard gain, and very little actual typing**  
*summary:* the dream? a clean, minimal keyboard that looks like a boutique board but was made in my bedroom with too much caffeine and questionable precision.

## june 8: the spark  
**2 hours**  
Was just chilling and saw a low-profile keyboard on Instagram that looked clean af.  
One Pinterest scroll later, I had 9 screenshots, 2 moodboards, and a burning desire to design one.  
Opened a new folder called `flat_af_keys` because naming is everything.  
Sketched some cursed layouts   some with knobs, some with too many keys, one was just arrows and a smiley face.  
Settled on a TKL-ish layout without the numpad. Compact but not annoying.

## june 9: cad panic begins  
**3.5 hours**  
Jumped into Fusion 360 like I knew what I was doing. I did not.  
Modeled the top plate and a basic bottom shell. Key spacing was off by a few mm at first and it triggered me deeply.  
Fixed it, learned how to do fillets properly   now the curves are curving.  
Printed a paper layout to check spacing and mock-typed on it like a nerd. Felt real.

## june 10: plate work but make it precise  
**3 hours**  
Worked on the plate design. Tried adding flex cuts but it just made it look like swiss cheese.  
Added standoff holes and support for screw-in stabs (finally).  
Printed another paper layout and cut it out like it was arts and crafts time.  
Felt way better than expected.

## june 11: wall thickness dilemma  
**3 hours**  
Tried 2mm, felt flimsy. 3mm, decent. 4mm, chef‚Äôs kiss.  
Modeled in the USB Type-C breakout   barely fit, but it fits.  
Lots of zooming and squinting. Changed wall profiles thrice.  
Slight redesign of the outer shape to feel a bit sleeker.

## june 12: youtube research = progress (kinda)  
**2 hours**  
Watched keyboard teardown videos while eating lunch. Called it research.  
Learned about keyboard tilt, gasket mounts, and why magnets are scary but cool.  
Added a slight tilt to the bottom shell. Contemplated making it magnetic.  
Decided not to   future Milan can deal with that.

## june 13: layered plate experiments  
**4 hours**  
Redesigned plate for laser cutting: layered style.  
Kerf offset math hurt my brain. My first SVG export looked like pixel soup.  
Adjusted and re-exported everything again.  
Finally got clean curves and spacing. Feels sharp now.

## june 14: mounting mayhem  
**3 hours**  
Switch mounting tolerances are no joke.  
Clip-in mounts worked okay-ish, plate-mount was a disaster.  
Added mini tabs for support   not pretty, but functional.  
Low-profile version? Bad idea. Deleted it. Good riddance.

## june 15: material wars  
**1.5 hours**  
Reddit thread got me deep into FR4 vs POM vs Acrylic vs ‚Äújust vibes.‚Äù  
Decided on acrylic for now   cheap, easy, and good RGB diffusion.  
Even if the board sucks, it‚Äôll glow.

## june 16: snap fit adventures  
**4 hours**  
Reworked the bottom case to be completely screwless.  
Snap fits and alignment pins galore.  
Modeled a dummy PCB just to make sure nothing collides.  
Debated doing a daughterboard. Didn‚Äôt. Not my circus (yet).

## june 17: overengineering top plate  
**3 hours**  
Felt like doing something dramatic so I redid the top half.  
Redesigned curves, internal supports, and added a magnet mount idea (again).  
Decided to keep it screw-fit for now but left magnets in the CAD for future me.

## june 19: the bom bom  
**2.5 hours**  
Started making the BOM. JST connectors are a different kind of pain.  
Compared like 5 datasheets before picking one that fits.  
This felt more like rocket science than keyboard making.

## june 20: case redesign ft. insecurities  
**3.5 hours**  
Showed renders to a friend who roasted the side profile.  
Redesigned the case that night   flatter, cleaner, less chonk.  
Fixed tolerances and the seam line. Case went from ‚Äúmeh‚Äù to ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôd buy this.‚Äù

## june 21: final stretch (lowkey tired)  
**3.5 hours**  
Cleaned up the Fusion project   like, properly.  
Every unused sketch got deleted. Every body named.  
Final render time. It felt... done. Almost.

## june 22: submission chaos  
**3 hours**  
Zipped the folder, double checked every STL and DXF.  
Filled the Hack Club Highway form.  
Was half-asleep when I hit submit.  
Immediately regretted not proofreading but whatever, we ball.

### final vibes  

This project made me fall in love with design and hate tolerances.  
Would I do it again? Absolutely. But next time, I‚Äôm getting laser eyes and a CNC machine.  
**flatkeys** started as a meme name and now it‚Äôs kind of iconic in my brain.  
Let‚Äôs see if it types.

**total time spent: 50 hours**
